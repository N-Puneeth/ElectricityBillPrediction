Model: Random Forest Regressor

Summary:
--------
A Random Forest regression model was trained to predict monthly electricity bills based on appliance      
usage, geographic location, and tariff rate. Real-world appliance power ratings were used to engineer    
meaningful energy consumption features like EstimatedEnergyKWh and EstimatedCost.

Features Used:
- Fan
- Refrigerator
- AirConditioner
- Television
- Monitor
- MotorPump
- MonthlyHours
- TariffRate
- EstimatedEnergyKWh
- EstimatedCost
- Month
- City
- Company
- City_Company (engineered)

Feature Importance (Top 5):
1. EstimatedCost
2. TariffRate
3. MonthlyHours
4. AirConditioner
5. Refrigerator

Model Results (on Test Set):
----------------------------
- RMSE: 17.83153
- RÂ² Score: 0.99972

Notes:
------
- Random Forest was selected due to its superior performance over linear regression.
- No hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation was applied in the final version due to already high performance.
- Feature importance plots and visual analysis supported model interpretability.
