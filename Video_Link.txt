 Demo Video Explanation Script:

   Hello, my name is NEPPALI PUNEETH KUMAR, and this is my submission for the IIITDM Electricity Bill Prediction Challenge.

 Problem Statement:
  The objective is to predict monthly electricity bills based on appliance usage, monthly usage hours, tariff rate, city, and company.    
  Accurate predictions can help utility providers forecast usage and detect anomalies.

 Dataset & Feature Engineering:  
   The dataset includes counts of appliances such as fans, ACs, refrigerators, etc., along with tariff and city/company info. I engineered new features using real-world appliance wattage:

- EstimatedEnergyKWh = (Power √ó Hours) / 1000
- EstimatedCost = Energy √ó Tariff Rate
- City_Company = Encoded combo of City + Company

These features help the model learn real energy behavior, not just appliance count.

‚öôÔ∏è Models Used:
I trained both Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

Results:
- Linear Regression ‚Üí RMSE: ~30 | R¬≤: 0.9992
- Random Forest ‚Üí RMSE: ~17.8 | R¬≤: 0.9997

The Random Forest Regressor clearly performed better, so I chose it for the final model.

üìà Visualizations like Actual vs Predicted plots and Feature Importance helped interpret results and build confidence in predictions.
 Conclusion:
Feature engineering based on real appliance power usage was key to improving accuracy and interpretability. This model could be useful for utility companies or campus energy management systems.

Thank you!
